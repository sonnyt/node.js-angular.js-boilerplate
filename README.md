node.js-angular.js-boilerplate
==============================

Simple boilerplate for Node.js and Angular.js

## Tech Stack

Single page web application is built using:
- Node.js
- Angular.js
- SASS
- Gulp.js

## Installation
1. Install NPM packages `npm install`
2. Install Bower components `bower install`
3. Build the application `gulp build`

After successfully finishing the build process. Gulp creates and stores all of the compiled and uglified files inside of a newly created "public" directory. 

## Notes
To run the application locally on your machine, call `node api/app`. Also, while developing it's recommended to run `gulp watch` to autocompile your assets while you make changes.
